<p>In this project, we show how to quantify the concept of gameplay &mdash; or action &mdash; by analyzing
players' controller inputs using probabilistic topic models. This stage in <i>Super Mario Bros. 3</i>,
for example, can be described as a blend of gameplay types with a 35% mix of jumping around flying
enemies and a 23% mix of making precise running jumps onto narrow platforms. Our method makes it possible
for developers to verify that their levels feature the appropriate style of gameplay and to recommend
levels with gameplay that is similar to levels that players like.

								<strong>Recommending Stages Based on Gameplay:</strong>
								<p class="mediadescription">Here is an example of how our method can recommend levels that play similarly to ones that players
like. Although these levels look quite different from each other at first glance, they all share this
primary type of gameplay: jumping around flying enemies and projectiles. Here we see (from top-left to
bottom-right) Flying Cheep-Cheeps, Fire Chomps and their fireballs, Podoboos, and Hammer Bros. Players
who like the type of action in one of these levels should enjoy the other levels as well.</p>

								<strong>Inferring Players' Choices with Controller Inputs Alone:</strong>
								<p class="mediadescription">Developers can also use our method to infer the specific choices that a player makes within a game, as
long as those choices manifest themselves in the controller inputs that he or she enters. As an example,
here is World 3-Fortress2 with and without the Frog Suit, respectively. The Frog Suit allows Mario to swim
in the water much more easily. This stage is difficult and culminates in a mini-boss fight, so many players
save a Frog Suit to wear for the occasion. By examining the gameplay type mixtures of a playthrough of this
level, we can tell whether the player wore the Frog Suit or completed it the hard way.</p>

								<strong>Real-Time Player Recognition:</strong>
								<p class="mediadescription">In addition to profiling game levels based on the gameplay types that they foster, our method uses players'
controller inputs to profile the players themselves. It automatically learns the distinguishing factors of
each player's unique playing style &mdash; factors such as floating a lot compared to other players and performing
maneuvers that only expert players can perform. Here we demonstrate a player recognition system based on
controller inputs alone. The three players took turns playing by passing the controller to each other every
45 seconds. The system can recognize a player from a database of eight players with over 90% accuracy in about
20 seconds of playtime, even for levels that the player has never played before and even when the controller
is passed from another player.</p>
